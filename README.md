## Introduction
Welcome to the VIT Chennai Bus Routes API! This documentation serves as a guide for developers and users interested in utilizing the API to access bus route information specifically designed for students at VIT Chennai. Our goal is to help freshers easily find the best bus routes near their homes, ensuring a smooth commuting experience.

## Tech Stack
The VIT Chennai Bus Routes application is built using the following technologies:

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows for the creation of scalable and efficient server-side applications. The backend is responsible for handling API requests, managing data, and serving the applicationâ€™s core functionality.
  
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, serverless database that is perfect for small to medium-sized applications. SQLite provides a simple way to store and retrieve route and stop information, making it an excellent choice for our project.

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: The frontend is developed using plain JavaScript without any additional frameworks or libraries. This approach allows for a lightweight and straightforward user interface that interacts seamlessly with the backend API. It ensures quick loading times and better performance, making it easy for users to find the bus routes they need.
